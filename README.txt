Trying to make a automata implementation library that is easy to code with and understand for beginners
PyFA = Python Finite Automata

The code written in this project is 100% written WITHOUT the help of AI. Every single logic for implementaion of various algorithm is derived by me (Eg. Partition Algorithm for DFA minimisation)
This Library doesn't aim to be most efficient at the algorithm's implementation (but I will optimize it as much as possible by myself), the aim of this library is for it to be easy to use the finite automata in python
